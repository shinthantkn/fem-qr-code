## My process

It's been quite a while since I've touched HTML and CSS, but I decided to start learning things again. This challenge was pretty easy for me, despite not having coded for a bit, I managed to write the solution code super easily. I started off by importing all the design files to figma and then used their tools to get the right dimensions, font sizes, etc. I used a minimal CSS reset by Kevin Powell. Of course, I didn't do all this without any additional help, I used Google and even ChatGPT if I wanted to ask a question. You'll soon realize that as a developer, you never stop googling or finding help.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I hope to continue perfecting my HTML and CSS skills, later out I'm planning to branch out to JavaScript and Python.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) - This bot is amazing! I used it when I had questions about which heading tags I should use and other semantic-related questions!
